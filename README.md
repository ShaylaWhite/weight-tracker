Weight-Tracker


Weight-Tracker was created to Allow users to track theor weights and keep up with their freinds and family weight progress as well as their own. Since the start of COVID-19 my freinds and I made a commitment and a competion to hold each other accountable and weight-tracker is perfect for this purpose.

Usage
To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
